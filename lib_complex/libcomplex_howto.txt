To build the static library libcomplex.a:

$ make liba

To build the dynamic library (shared object) libcomplex.so:

$ make libd

To make the case study usage example:

$ make use

To remove temporary files, the libraries and the executable

$ make clean

IMPORTANT NOTE:
if you are using the dynamic library "libcomplex.so"
before running "use_complex" for the first time
you must run the following shell command:                                      

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH                        

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a shell variable that, similarly to PATH,
contains a list of ":" separated directories that show the
operating system where to find the ".so" files at runtime.
The above command adds the current directory "." to that list.
